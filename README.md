# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization
A repository containing my final project for course CS 330, with a small set of prompts to answer as well.

~How did I approach designing the software?

I didn't have any particularly specific design patterns that I implemented for creating this project, simply because it's unnecessary. Typically my design philosophy revolves around KISS (keep it short and simple). I add complexity to things only when it's a necessary task to reach a parameter set for whatever I am working on and this project was no different. We were supplied base code from the get go and I simply modified that base code as needed throughout the course to fit my new and changing requirements. A problem I bumped into with the project however was that I needed to completely redesign my code from the ground up in order to do what I needed it to. Regardless I still used the same concept from before, which was to modify something to fit my needs. Had I been in a different scenario, I have no problems with starting from scratch. But an 8 week course is a bit difficult to get a well rounded understanding of OpenGL to write everything from scratch when you have a fully working program you can modulate.

~How did I approach developing the program?

In terms of any development strategies used for the project? Mostly I had to think outside of the box for the 3D scene a bit. Alongside making things short and simple, I like to also do things that are interesting and a bit unorthodox. Our 3D scene was supposed to have 4 3D objects in it. I wanted to make a Rubik's cube (which at first I thought was going to be 27 separate cube objects). Over time I realized this was a bit silly and I turned my 3D scene's objects into having a table instead. This table had 5 objects in total used to create it. The cube was also made with 6 objects, by technicality. This was done to facilitate having 6 different faces of 9 separate squares of color like a rubik's cube.

~How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This course helped me get a good taste at working with APIs as well as getting includes and dependencies to work. Programming is one thing, but making my code work along side other parts and making it all work in harmony is absolutely something else and can get a bit messy.
